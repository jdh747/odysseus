So here‚Äôs a divisive one‚Ä¶

Have you ever experienced the first world misfortune of a rate limited public Wi-Fi that cuts you off after a) having exceeding upload/download limits, or b) overstaying your 30min welcome?

As a thought experiment, let's suggest that many of these networks rely upon a fairly lazy form of MAC-based authentication: a form authentication that tracks your MAC address through cyberspace and executes network rules against you by way of this ‚Äòunique‚Äô identifier. And furthermore, many laptop-based wireless cards enable you to modify this MAC address. How might one circumvent the interweb overlords that would otherwise deprive you of your viral Rickroll memes?

Brief interlude: For those unfamiliar with MAC addresses and unwilling to engage Google for enlightenment, here‚Äôs something I prepared earlier:

>‚ÄúA media access control address of a device is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller. For communications within a network segment, it is used as a network address for most IEEE 802 network technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.‚Äù -- Wikipedia

In effect, this is saying the wireless module (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth card) in your device has a unique identifier bestowed upon it by its creator -- the manufacturer. And this identifier is used by many network protocols for doing useful things‚Ä¶ Like blocking your memes.

Network Interface Controllers (NICs) hard-code their MAC address; however, in a convenient twist of fate, many drivers allow the MAC address perceived by the operating system to be modified quite easily. Enter ‚ÄòMAC Spoofing.‚Äô

# Level 1: Overstaying Our Welcome

Problem #1 comes about when a network severs our connection to the universe after having exceeded some sort of quota, be it time- or data-based. In this scenario, the orchestrator of the network has placed our address in an access control list that prevents further access until network rules are met: timeout or buyout.

This is an easy one to fix -- just get a new address!

What follows will be a series of Mac-based terminal commands (convenient, really, given the topic üòâ), but I‚Äôll endeavour to include Linux equivalents where I can. They shouldn‚Äôt diverge too much, anyway. If you‚Äôre team Windows, you‚Äôre on your own -- I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶

## Step 0: Dependencies

We‚Äôll be using `ifconfig`, `openssl`, `sed`, `awk`, and `nmap` in the following. Most should be pre-installed builtins, but if you find yourself lacking any of the tools (likely `openssl` or `nmap`) install via homebrew (Mac only) with‚Ä¶

```
brew install {package_name}
```

## Step 1: Get & Set Your MAC Address

`ifconfig` is a useful built-in command on most Unix-based (Mac & Linux) operating systems that both gives us useful information about network interfaces, and allows us to configure them.

So, just run:

```
ifconfig {interface} ether
```

Where `{interface}` is your network card, usually `en0`, and `ether` requests the link-level (OSI model) address of the interface, aka the MAC address:

```
ifconfig en0 ether
```
  
Generates something akin to:

```
en0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
ether 39:42:b3:af:c3:99
```

This tells us that our MAC address is currently `39:42:b3:af:c3:99`. But that just got blocked by the feudal lords of the network, so let‚Äôs replace it.

This can be done simply enough with an extension of our prior command:

```
sudo ifconfig en0 ether <new_mac_address>  # sudo required to modify an interface
```

E.g.

```
sudo ifconfig en0 ether 49:47:4e:64:61:e9
```

This will bring the interface down briefly, re-program the link-level address, then bring it back up again. Voila! Your Wi-Fi access should automatically re-authenticate and give you fresh access to the network as a new user. You can double-check by re-running the first command. The result should match what you fed in.

## Step 2: Bonus Points

If you want to streamline this process a bit, you can have a new address automatically generated for you with the help of `openssl` for generating randomness, and `sed` for stream-editing into something useful. Give this a spin:

```
sudo ifconfig en0 ether $(openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/.$//')
```

# Level 2: Plus-Ones Welcome?

Ok, so we‚Äôre covered if we‚Äôre booted off a public network when the network decides we‚Äôve overstayed. But what about hotels and other such establishments that ban you from the get-go unless you forfeit an extortion fee scaled in 10min time blocks. What then?!

Well, we have a solution for that, too.

But this scenario differs in that we must now identify as a user of the network that has already been authenticated. To achieve this, we‚Äôll harness the powers of `nmap` to scan for active devices.

First, we need our IP address. Comparable to retrieving a MAC address with one minor tweak, run:

```
ifconfig en0 inet
```

To generate:

```
en0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
inet 192.168.1.60 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255
```

This tells us that our current IP address is `192.168.1.60`. Use this to scan the network for other devices:

```
sudo nmap -sn {ip_address}/24  # sudo required to retrieve MAC addresses
```

E.g.

```
sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.60/24
```

Telling `nmap` to complete a ping scan of our IP with something akin to a subnet mask of 24-bits so, in effect, ‚Äúplease scan IP addresses 192.168.1.0 through 192.168.1.255, thank-you.‚Äù This will give you a list of results (hopefully) that look something like this:

```
MAC Address: 10:a9:58:65:5a:c8 (Samsung Electronics)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.60
Host is up (0.079s latency).
MAC Address: dd:88:fa:5d:29:f8 (Google)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.61
Host is up (0.24s latency).
MAC Address: f0:c9:3b:9e:82:cf (Apple)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.62
Host is up (0.016s latency).
```

Now all that‚Äôs left is to adopt one of the given addresses -- easy peasy!

```
sudo ifconfig en0 ether f0:c9:3b:9e:82:cf  # Borrowing Apple‚Äôs address
```

Once your interface has dropped and re-authenticated, you should find your Twitch live-streaming, once again, unobscured.

# Level 3: Convenient Automation

In the spirit of convenience, this can be wrapped up into one tidy script available as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/jdh747/908110e353ff582071f533af2c909c4d).

It has 3 flag-induced usages:

1. `mac-spoof --set {mac_address}`: to set your MAC address as desired;
2. `mac-spoof --randomise`: to randomly assign a MAC address (Level 1);
3. `mac-spoof --select`: to scan for available MAC addresses and select from the list presented (Level 2);

	echo $(ifconfig en0 ether | grep ether | rev | cut -d' ' -f2 | rev)

# Be Nice: A Word of Warning

I suggest being considerate with this knowledge and tailoring your use according to the types of paywalls you encounter. If, for instance, you‚Äôre confronted with a paywall that charges by the data consumed, it would be pretty darn inconsiderate to blitz a paying users quota.
