# **What** is Joshua Hayes?
- Former:
    - Child;
    - Melbourne-based teenage "muzza" <-- complete with mullet, GHD hair straightener, and an interesting choice of vernacular;
    - Unenthused corporate accounts person;
    - Student of Mechatronics;
- Current:
    - Child;
    - Enthused Software Engineer;
    - Fanboy and tinkerer of: Linux, IoT electronics, Golang & Python languages (sometimes Node.js), Dockerising all the things... Since we're just reciting buzzwords at this point, lets throw Crypto in for good measure. But not Bitcoin -- that's *too* mainstream;
    - Following a knee injury, I thought it an ideal time to become an aspiring runner. Make fun of me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/37836057);
    - Soon-to-be semi-frequent writer of great content and rants here and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@joshhayes747)
