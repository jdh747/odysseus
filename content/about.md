Some call me Josh, others JD (context: middle name Drew), and others still -- for reasons I can't fathom -- JJ. Call me whatever you want. Keep insults to a minimum... Here's a short summary of my time on this little blue pebble:

* Former:
  * Child;
  * Melbourne-based teenage hoodlum and self-identified "muzza" <-- complete with mullet and an *interesting* choice of vernacular;
  * Unenthused corporate accounts person;
  * Student of Mechatronics;
* Current:
  * Enthused Software Engineer;
  * Fanboy and tinkerer of all buzz words: Linux; IoT & electronics; hacking together (mostly excessive and unnecessary) solutions to life's abundant supply of nuisances with Golang & Python (sometimes Node.js, if I'm feeling particularly masochistic); Dockerising all the things;
  * I wrecked my knee... Ideal timing to become an aspiring runner/cyclist, no? Follow my progress (or lack thereof) on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/37836057);
  * Soon-to-be semi-frequent writer of great content and rants here and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@joshhayes747).
