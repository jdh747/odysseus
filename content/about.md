A short summary of my time on this little blue pebble...

* Born and raised in some combination of Melbourne/Perth, Australia;
* Unenthused corporate finance person;
* Mechatronics Student @ Curtin University (Perth, Australia);
* Current:
  * Software Engineer @ [Motion Design](https://motiondesign.nz/);
  * Tinkerer. Using software to excessively solve problems I never knew I had, occasionally delving into the world of electronics and embedded devices;
  * Full disclosure: I find the word 'Linux' and any related topic to be over-stimulating;
  * Sometimes I offset the sedentary dev life with [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/37836057);
  * Occasionally, my written ramblings make it [here](/posts) and/or [Medium](https://medium.com/@joshhayes747).
