# *What* is it?
Some call me Josh, others JD (context: middle name Drew), and others still -- for reasons I can't fathom -- JJ. Call me whatever you want. Keep insults to a minimum... Here's a short summary of my time on this little blue pebble:

- Former:
    - Child;
    - Melbourne-based teenage hoodlum and self-identified "muzza" <-- complete with mullet and an *interesting* choice of vernacular;
    - Unenthused corporate accounts person;
    - Student of Mechatronics;
- Current:
    - Enthused Software Engineer;
    - Fanboy and tinkerer of all buzz words (Except Bitcoin -- that's *too* mainstream): Linux; IoT & electronics; Hacking together solutions to life's abundant supply of nuisances with Golang & Python (sometimes Node.js, if I'm feeling particularly masochistic); Dockerising all the things;
    - I wrecked my knee... I think it's an ideal time to become an aspiring runner/cyclist. Follow my progress (or lack thereof) on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/37836057);
    - Soon-to-be semi-frequent writer of great content and rants here and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@joshhayes747).
